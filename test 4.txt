1)Hypothesis Testing:
	Firstly,hypothesis is an assumption which is used to determine the relationship between two data sets.
        Hypothesis testing is a stastical test or a systematic way to select samples from a group or population with 
        the purpose of making a stastical decisions using experimental data.
 Types:
      -> Null Hypothesis
      -> Alternate Hypothesis

 Null hypothesis is used in statistics that defines no statistical significance or no variation exist in a set of given observations.
 In this type,the researcher's prediction is not true.
 Alternate hypothesis is used in hypothesis testing which is opposite to null hypothesis and here the researcher's predicted difference is true.

2)Correlation:
	Correlation tell us about two variables are related by the use of statistical tools and techniques.The measure of correlation
        between two variables is called correlation coefficient.It also measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship 
        between two or more variables.

    a.Various methods for computing correlation
        ->Scatter diagram method
        ->Karl pearson's coefficient of correlation
        ->Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
        ->Methods of least squares

    b.Correlation in Biomedical Engineering and Technology:
        ->Cardiac output measurement is the invasive pulmonary artery catheterization and the application of thermodilution method
          to estimate the blood flow.It is a invasive method and thermodilution method are sensitive to many physical and biological disturbances.
         Therefore someother methods are looked for i.e. cardiac output measurements based on cross correlation signal analysis.
       ->Using correlation coefficient in ECG waveform for arrhythmia detection.
       ->Correlation of mRNA expression and signal variability in chronic intracortical electrodes.

    c.p-value in correlation:
         P-value are often used in hypothesis to determine whether you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
         p-value for pearson's correlation coefficient uses the t-distribution.
         t=r*squareroot(n-2)/squareroot(1-r power of 2)
         p-value is 2*p(T>t)
         where,
              T follows a t distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom.
